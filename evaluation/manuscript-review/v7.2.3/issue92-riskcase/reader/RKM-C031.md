**Source ID:** `RKM-C031`; **source title:** `AssessmentActivity`; **layer:** `FORMAL_CORE`; **native representation:** `Class`.

**Subdomain:** [D05 · Risk Assessment](Subdomains.md#d05)

## Authored source definition

An actual activity contributing to risk identification, analysis or evaluation. It may cover only part of a risk assessment; the complete standardized assessment process is outside the current process-modeling scope.

## Identity and source typing

- OntoUML stereotype: `event`; abstract: `false`.
- Identity supplier: No identity supplier is assigned in this source record.
- Identity basis: An actual happening individuated by supported temporal extent, participants and occurrence boundaries.
- Typing rationale: Event interpretation; a description, plan or possibility is not an event instance.
- Source aliases: None recorded.

## Direct catalog associations

| ID | Position and source predicate | Other endpoint | Source-end multiplicity | Target-end multiplicity | Layer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-26 | outgoing `producesAssessmentInformation` | [Assessment Information](RKM-C032.md) | 0..* | 0..* | FORMAL_CORE |
| R-51 | outgoing `assessmentPerformer` | [Agent](RKM-C047.md) | 0..* | 0..* | FORMAL_CORE |
| R-71 | incoming `refersToAssessmentActivity` | [Evidence Reference](RKM-C065.md) | 0..* | 0..* | FORMAL_CORE |

The source-end multiplicity counts sources per target; the target-end multiplicity counts targets per source. Position describes the source record, not asserted navigability. Optional bridges are catalog information, not typed-core relations.

## Direct inheritance

Direct supertypes: None recorded.  
Direct subtypes: None recorded.

## Evidence and alignment boundary

**Authored source status:** Bounded review and finite tests; native OntoUML and independent semantic validation pending

The source status is preserved verbatim. The [candidate execution receipts](../README.md) separately report the current bounded structural and engine checks. Neither the source label nor this generated page supplies independent semantic acceptance, a sourced external definition or standards equivalence. Term-level external alignment is not inferred here.
