**Source ID:** `RKM-C026`; **source title:** `IdentificationInformation`; **layer:** `FORMAL_CORE`; **native representation:** `Class`.

**Subdomain:** [D04 · Risk Registration](Subdomains.md#d04)

## Authored source definition

Recorded information about identifying a risk, including the stated source, channel, agent and available time information.

## Identity and source typing

- OntoUML stereotype: `subkind`; abstract: `false`.
- Identity supplier: [Information Artifact](RKM-C014.md)
- Identity basis: Inherits documentary identity from InformationArtifact, or version identity from ArtifactVersion through an explicit generalization path.
- Typing rationale: Essential documentary specialization in the bounded risk-knowledge profile; label equality does not establish identity.
- Source aliases: None recorded.

## Direct catalog associations

| ID | Position and source predicate | Other endpoint | Source-end multiplicity | Target-end multiplicity | Layer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-07 | outgoing `identifiedRisk` | [Risk Case](RKM-X01.md) | 0..* | 1 | FORMAL_CORE |
| R-08 | outgoing `hasParticipantReference` | [Actor Reference](RKM-C050.md) | 0..* | 0..* | FORMAL_CORE |
| R-27 | outgoing `declaresIntakeChannel` | [Intake Channel Term](RKM-C027.md) | 0..* | 0..* | FORMAL_CORE |
| R-52 | incoming `recordsIdentification` | [Entry Revision](RKM-C023.md) | 1..* | 0..* | FORMAL_CORE |

The source-end multiplicity counts sources per target; the target-end multiplicity counts targets per source. Position describes the source record, not asserted navigability. Optional bridges are catalog information, not typed-core relations.

## Direct inheritance

Direct supertypes: [Information Artifact](RKM-C014.md)  
Direct subtypes: None recorded.

## Evidence and alignment boundary

**Authored source status:** Bounded review and finite tests; native OntoUML and independent semantic validation pending

The source status is preserved verbatim. The [candidate execution receipts](../README.md) separately report the current bounded structural and engine checks. Neither the source label nor this generated page supplies independent semantic acceptance, a sourced external definition or standards equivalence. Term-level external alignment is not inferred here.
