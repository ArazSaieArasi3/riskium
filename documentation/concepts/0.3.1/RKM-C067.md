# Observation Activity

**Source ID:** `RKM-C067` · **Subdomain:** [D10 · Risk Monitoring](Subdomains.md) · **Layer:** `FORMAL_CORE`

## Current authored definition

An activity that observes a stated feature of a subject using a declared procedure and temporal context.

## Identity and modeling

- OntoUML stereotype: `event`; abstract: `false`.
- Identity supplier: `None`.
- Identity basis: An actual happening individuated by supported temporal extent, participants and occurrence boundaries.
- Typing rationale: Event interpretation; a description, plan or possibility is not an event instance.

## External definition and alignment status

No separately sourced external definition or term-level standards equivalence is recorded for this identifier in the model catalog. The [inspected source register](../../../references/README.md) is context, not proof of one-to-one alignment. A future alignment requires the exact source passage, edition, relation type, reviewer and rationale; absent that record, status is **unassessed**.

## Evidence and limits

Bounded review and finite tests; native OntoUML and independent semantic validation pending
The authored definition and link inventory are source facts; they do not constitute independent semantic validation. [Quality evidence](../../../evaluation/quality/README.md) keeps formal and application outcomes separate.
