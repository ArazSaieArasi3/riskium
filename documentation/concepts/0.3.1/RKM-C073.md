# Risk Appetite Statement

**Source ID:** `RKM-C073` · **Subdomain:** [D11 · Risk Policy](Subdomains.md) · **Layer:** `FORMAL_CORE`

## Current authored definition

A managed, versioned statement recording the kinds and extent of risk an organization is prepared to pursue or retain, qualified by source framework, objectives, authority and context.

## Identity and modeling

- OntoUML stereotype: `subkind`; abstract: `false`.
- Identity supplier: [Information Artifact](RKM-C014.md).
- Identity basis: Inherits documentary identity from InformationArtifact, or version identity from ArtifactVersion through an explicit generalization path.
- Typing rationale: Essential documentary specialization in the bounded risk-knowledge profile; label equality does not establish identity.

## External definition and alignment status

No separately sourced external definition or term-level standards equivalence is recorded for this identifier in the model catalog. The [inspected source register](../../../references/README.md) is context, not proof of one-to-one alignment. A future alignment requires the exact source passage, edition, relation type, reviewer and rationale; absent that record, status is **unassessed**.

## Evidence and limits

Bounded review and finite tests; native OntoUML and independent semantic validation pending
The authored definition and link inventory are source facts; they do not constitute independent semantic validation. [Quality evidence](../../../evaluation/quality/README.md) keeps formal and application outcomes separate.
