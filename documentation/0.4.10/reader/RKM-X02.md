## Authored source definition

A managed information item identifying an objective in its source context, without asserting that the information item is the objective.

## Identity and source typing

- OntoUML stereotype: `subkind`; abstract: `false`.
- Identity supplier: [Information Artifact](RKM-C014.md)
- Identity basis: Inherits documentary identity from InformationArtifact, or version identity from ArtifactVersion through an explicit generalization path.
- Typing rationale: Essential documentary specialization in the bounded risk-knowledge profile; label equality does not establish identity.
- Source aliases: None recorded.

## Direct catalog associations

| ID | Position and source predicate | Other endpoint | Source-end multiplicity | Target-end multiplicity | Layer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RK2-011 | incoming `referencesObjective` | [Risk Context Specification](RKM-C002.md) | 0..* | 0..* | FORMAL_CORE |
| RX-003 | incoming `concernsObjective` | [Risk Case](RKM-X01.md) | 0..* | 1..* | FORMAL_CORE |

The source-end multiplicity counts sources per target; the target-end multiplicity counts targets per source. Position describes the source record, not asserted navigability. Optional bridges are catalog information, not typed-core relations.

## Direct inheritance

Direct supertypes: [Information Artifact](RKM-C014.md)<br>
Direct subtypes: None recorded.

## Current documentary comparisons

**Disposition:** `CONTRAST` · reviewed 2026-11-10.

Retain the distinction between an informational reference and the objective it identifies. Generic PROV Entity has broad provenance scope and does not alone determine referent identity or objective achievement.

RX-003 connects analytical RiskCase to objective references; RK2-011 allows context-specific references. Revised RiskCase meaning was reviewed. The reference can identify source-context objectives without importing an entire organization ontology or asserting that the objective has been achieved.

### prov:Entity

**Selected source meaning (paraphrase):** A thing considered through fixed aspects, including conceptual or imaginary things.

**Source and locator:** [PROV-O: The PROV Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/), W3C Recommendation, 30 April 2013; [§4.1, Entity](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/#Entity). Inspected 2026-11-10.

**Inspected scope:** Terms listed below only; no PROV conformance or import asserted.

**Review role:** Assistant-supported source comparison, current ancestry/neighbor/set-policy and selected treatment/policy contracts; normative deferrals explicit; not independent expert or operational evaluation.

Formal alignment remains **unassessed**; no OWL/SKOS equivalence, imported source restriction or independent semantic rating is generated.

## Evidence and alignment boundary

**Authored source status:** Bounded review and finite tests; native OntoUML and independent semantic validation pending

The source status is preserved verbatim. The [qualification and publication plan](../../../plans/v0.3.9.md) separately report the current bounded structural and engine checks. The source status and documentary comparisons do not supply independent semantic acceptance or formal standards equivalence. Domain comparisons and modeling foundations are distinguished below.
