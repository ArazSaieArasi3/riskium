## Authored source definition

A managed information artifact identifying or describing a claimed contributor to risk in a declared context. The referenced contributor may be unresolved, hypothetical or heterogeneous. The reference does not establish actual causation or an actual occurrence.

## Identity and source typing

- OntoUML stereotype: `subkind`; abstract: `false`.
- Identity supplier: [Information Artifact](RKM-C014.md)
- Identity basis: Governed documentary identity, inherited from InformationArtifact; source-reference identity is distinct from source-bearer identity.
- Typing rationale: A documentary reference can be uniformly typed without forcing its heterogeneous referents into one category.
- Source aliases: None recorded.

## Direct catalog associations

| ID | Position and source predicate | Other endpoint | Source-end multiplicity | Target-end multiplicity | Layer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RK3-001 | incoming `hasSourceReference` | [Risk Case](RKM-X01.md) | 0..* | 0..* | FORMAL_CORE |
| RK3-002 | outgoing `resolvesToSource` | [Risk Source](RKM-C007.md) | 0..* | 0..1 | OPTIONAL_EXTERNAL_BRIDGE |
| RK3-003 | outgoing `sourceReferenceContext` | [Risk Context Specification](RKM-C002.md) | 0..* | 0..1 | FORMAL_CORE |

The source-end multiplicity counts sources per target; the target-end multiplicity counts targets per source. Position describes the source record, not asserted navigability. Optional bridges are catalog information, not typed-core relations.

## Direct inheritance

Direct supertypes: [Information Artifact](RKM-C014.md)<br>
Direct subtypes: None recorded.

## Current documentary comparisons

**Disposition:** `CONTRAST` · reviewed 2026-11-10.

Retain the document/referent contrast. A managed contributor reference may describe an unresolved or hypothetical contributor; it is not that contributor or evidence of actual causation.

G3-001 supplies documentary identity. RK3-001 concerns an analytical RiskCase; RK3-002 is the distinct source-resolution link and RK3-003 supplies context. No universal bearer category or operational-admission requirement is introduced.

### prov:Entity

**Selected source meaning (paraphrase):** A thing considered through fixed aspects, including conceptual or imaginary things.

**Source and locator:** [PROV-O: The PROV Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/), W3C Recommendation, 30 April 2013; [§4.1, Entity](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/#Entity). Inspected 2026-11-10.

**Inspected scope:** Terms listed below only; no PROV conformance or import asserted.

### Threat Source

**Selected source meaning (paraphrase):** Intent/method or a situation/method potentially exploiting a vulnerability.

**Inspected scope:** Security-specific terms, selected glossary entries and tables only; not a universal enterprise-risk vocabulary. Glossary entries retain their original attributions.

**Review role:** Assistant-supported selected primary-passage comparison plus explicit source ancestry, changed-neighbor and set-policy review; no independent expert rating.

Formal alignment remains **unassessed**; no OWL/SKOS equivalence, imported source restriction or independent semantic rating is generated.

## Evidence and alignment boundary

**Authored source status:** Bounded review and finite tests; native OntoUML and independent semantic validation pending

The source status is preserved verbatim. The [qualification and publication plan](../../../plans/v0.3.9.md) separately report the current bounded structural and engine checks. The source status and documentary comparisons do not supply independent semantic acceptance or formal standards equivalence. Domain comparisons and modeling foundations are distinguished below.
