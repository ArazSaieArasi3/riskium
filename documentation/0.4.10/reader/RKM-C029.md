## Authored source definition

A controlled value preserving the source-defined position or role of a consequence statement. This is a managed vocabulary resource with scheme-qualified identity, not a bare string.

## Identity and source typing

- OntoUML stereotype: `subkind`; abstract: `false`.
- Identity supplier: [Information Artifact](RKM-C014.md)
- Identity basis: Inherits documentary identity from InformationArtifact, or version identity from ArtifactVersion through an explicit generalization path.
- Typing rationale: Essential documentary specialization in the bounded risk-knowledge profile; label equality does not establish identity.
- Source aliases: None recorded.

## Direct catalog associations

| ID | Position and source predicate | Other endpoint | Source-end multiplicity | Target-end multiplicity | Layer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-40 | incoming `sourceSlot` | [Consequence Statement](RKM-C025.md) | 0..* | 1 | FORMAL_CORE |

The source-end multiplicity counts sources per target; the target-end multiplicity counts targets per source. Position describes the source record, not asserted navigability. Optional bridges are catalog information, not typed-core relations.

## Direct inheritance

Direct supertypes: [Classification Term](RKM-C019.md)<br>
Direct subtypes: None recorded.

## Current documentary comparisons

**Disposition:** `RELATED` · reviewed 2026-11-10.

Retain vocabulary-concept context for the source-defined consequence position/function. A slot is not a universal outcome ordering, a severity value or an actual consequence.

R-40 preserves the original statement's source slot. The inherited documentary identity does not equate identical strings across schemes or force a scalar selection when multiple assertions apply.

### skos:Concept

**Selected source meaning (paraphrase):** A knowledge-organization notion; using it does not automatically identify an OWL class.

**Source and locator:** [SKOS Simple Knowledge Organization System Reference](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-skos-reference-20090818/), W3C Recommendation, 18 August 2009; [§3, especially §§3.1 and 3.5.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-skos-reference-20090818/#concepts). Inspected 2026-11-10.

**Inspected scope:** Concept, scheme and lexical-label distinctions; no SKOS mapping triples asserted.

**Review role:** Assistant-supported primary-passage comparison and current ancestry/neighbor/set-policy plus selected registration/workflow source-contract checks; not an instance or independent expert evaluation.

[Original decision and evidence route](../../../evaluation/releases/v0.3.9/followups/issue85-structural-review/batch-03/review.json) · [Current review component](../../../references/concept-definitions/0.2.0/review.json) · [All 82 dispositions](External-Definitions.md).

Formal alignment remains **unassessed**; no OWL/SKOS equivalence, imported source restriction or independent semantic rating is generated.

## Evidence and alignment boundary

**Authored source status:** Bounded review and finite tests; native OntoUML and independent semantic validation pending

The source status is preserved verbatim. The [qualification and publication plan](../../../plans/v0.3.9.md) separately report the current bounded structural and engine checks. The source status and documentary comparisons do not supply independent semantic acceptance or formal standards equivalence. Domain comparisons and modeling foundations are distinguished below.
