# Plan Role Term

**Source ID:** `RKM-C046` · **Subdomain:** [D06 · Risk Treatment](Subdomains.md) · **Layer:** `FORMAL_CORE`

## Current authored definition

A controlled value describing the role of a plan, such as primary response or contingency. This is a managed vocabulary resource with scheme-qualified identity, not a bare string.

## Identity and modeling

- OntoUML stereotype: `subkind`; abstract: `false`.
- Identity supplier: [Information Artifact](RKM-C014.md).
- Identity basis: Inherits documentary identity from InformationArtifact, or version identity from ArtifactVersion through an explicit generalization path.
- Typing rationale: Essential documentary specialization in the bounded risk-knowledge profile; label equality does not establish identity.

## External definition and alignment status

**Documentary disposition:** `RELATED` · reviewed 2026-11-05.

**Authored comparison:** Primary/contingency are locally governed plan-role values; SKOS provides a vocabulary pattern rather than those domain meanings.

**External source definition (paraphrase):** A knowledge-organization notion; using it does not automatically identify an OWL class.

**Source:** SKOS Simple Knowledge Organization System Reference. W3C Recommendation, 18 August 2009. [§3, especially §§3.1 and 3.5.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-skos-reference-20090818/#concepts). Accessed 2026-11-05.

**Inspected scope:** Concept, scheme and lexical-label distinctions; no SKOS mapping triples asserted.

Formal equivalence and subsumption remain **unassessed**. This documentary comparison asserts no OWL or SKOS alignment axiom and records no independent semantic rating.

## Evidence and limits

Bounded review and finite tests; native OntoUML and independent semantic validation pending
The authored definition and link inventory are source facts; they do not constitute independent semantic validation. [Quality evidence](../../../evaluation/quality/README.md) keeps formal and application outcomes separate.
