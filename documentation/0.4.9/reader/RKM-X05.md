**Subdomain:** [D06 · Risk Treatment](Subdomains.md#d06)

## Authored source definition

A managed identifier or description of a claimed control whose real-world bearer may remain unresolved.

## Identity and source typing

- OntoUML stereotype: `subkind`; abstract: `false`.
- Identity supplier: [Information Artifact](RKM-C014.md)
- Identity basis: Inherits documentary identity from InformationArtifact, or version identity from ArtifactVersion through an explicit generalization path.
- Typing rationale: Essential documentary specialization in the bounded risk-knowledge profile; label equality does not establish identity.
- Source aliases: None recorded.

## Direct catalog associations

| ID | Position and source predicate | Other endpoint | Source-end multiplicity | Target-end multiplicity | Layer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RK2-016 | incoming `recordsControlReference` | [Entry Revision](RKM-C023.md) | 0..* | 0..* | FORMAL_CORE |
| RK2-022 | incoming `referencesControlBaseline` | [Assessment Basis](RKM-C033.md) | 0..* | 0..* | FORMAL_CORE |
| RX-020 | outgoing `resolvesToControl` | [Risk Control](RKM-C045.md) | 0..* | 0..1 | OPTIONAL_EXTERNAL_BRIDGE |

The source-end multiplicity counts sources per target; the target-end multiplicity counts targets per source. Position describes the source record, not asserted navigability. Optional bridges are catalog information, not typed-core relations.

## Direct inheritance

Direct supertypes: [Information Artifact](RKM-C014.md)<br>
Direct subtypes: None recorded.

## Evidence and alignment boundary

**Authored source status:** Bounded review and finite tests; native OntoUML and independent semantic validation pending

The source status is preserved verbatim. The [qualification and publication plan](../../../plans/v0.3.9.md) separately report the current bounded structural and engine checks. Neither the source label nor this generated page supplies independent semantic acceptance, a sourced external definition or standards equivalence. Term-level external alignment is not inferred here.
